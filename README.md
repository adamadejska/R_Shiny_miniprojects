This repository contains a personal project. I have made an R Shiny App that analyzes  single-cell RNA-seq data using Seurat library (https://satijalab.org/seurat/).
You can check out the demo of this app in the video below (also available as a file in the repository).

This demo uses a sample of the test dataset pbmc3k provided by Seurat github page found here (https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-data).
